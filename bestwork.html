    <td><h2>Module 5 Navigation Bar</h2>In this website you can find things I like to do in my free time, news at Davenport West High School, and some of my contact information. I like this website because it is organized and all set up.

  <td><h2>Jedds Tree Care</h2> This website is intresting because their is five different pages on it. That makes it cool because it has a lot of information on one webside. Another really cool thing that I like about this website is in the footer the facebook, twitter, and instagram icons.</td>

<tr>
  <td><h2>Recipe Page</h2> This page is intresting because it has five differnt recipes for cookies. On this website I wish I  would of changed the font color from black to white so that it would stand out more. Other than that I like the way how one side of the table has the ingediants and the side next to it has the directions in order.</td>
